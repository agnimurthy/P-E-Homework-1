What is the difference between a for loop and a while loop?

the for() loop is designed to define a variable, set a looping condition 
to exectue the code, and make a change to the variable

a while() loop is more broad and general in it's structure, 
and requires typing out all of the required code in it's logical order, 
rather than having a certain syntax like the for() command



What are the four parts of a for loop? What do they do?

First, you have the three parts of the syntax in the for loop

First, defining a variable: var x = 0
Setting a boolean test (to perform the code inside the loop while this condition is met): while (x <= width)
Then, a change in the variable: x = x+50
and the last part is the code that runs inside the loop

example:

for ( var x = 0; x <=width; x += 50) {
rect(x,50,10,10)
}



What does "nested" mean in the context of nested loops?

Nested loops perform looping operations simultaneously.
While one loop is active, so is the other loop.

rather than executing two loops separately, which would have a different result.
